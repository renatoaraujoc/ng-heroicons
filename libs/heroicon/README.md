# NG Heroicon v3.0.1

## \# This project has been deprecated \#

There are many projects out there that provides a set of high quality icons for Angular, and I'm
no longer maintaining this project.

I did a simple rewrite of the [old repository](https://github.com/renatoaraujoc/heroicons/tree/master/angular/heroicons) that contains the version `2.1.0` and bumped the version (here)
to `3.0.1` that also supports `Angular 16.x`. This will contain (I believe) breaking changes, so **I strongly 
advise you to migrate to something else**.

Sorry for any trouble that this may have caused, working as a full stack engineer + devops is consuming too much
of my time to maintain any OSS project :(
