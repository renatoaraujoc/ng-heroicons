# NG Heroicon

## \# This project has been deprecated \#

There are many projects out there that provides a set of high quality icons for Angular, and I'm 
no longer maintaining this project.

I did a simple rewrite of the [old repository](https://github.com/renatoaraujoc/heroicons/tree/master/angular/heroicons) that contains the version `2.1.0` and bumped the version (here)
to `3.0.0` that also supports Angular 16.x. This will contain (I believe) breaking changes, so I advise you to, 
again, to migrate to something else.

I strongly advise everyone to migrate to something else.
